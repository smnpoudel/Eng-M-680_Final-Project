#Wildfire Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts wildfire occurrences and sizes using machine learning models based on weather and geospatial data. It combines multiple datasets to enhance predictive accuracy and provides insights into the relationships between environmental factors and wildfire activity.

## Project Workflow
The project is divided into the following stages:
1.⁠ ⁠*Data Loading*: Import wildfire data, weather readings, and weather station metadata.
2.⁠ ⁠*Data Cleaning*: Preprocess the datasets to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and errors.
3.⁠ ⁠*Dataset Merging*: Integrate datasets based on geographic and temporal attributes.
4.⁠ ⁠*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Analyze data patterns, correlations, and outliers.
5.⁠ ⁠*Feature Engineering*: Create derived features to improve model performance.
6.⁠ ⁠*Model Training*: Train machine learning models to predict wildfire occurrences and sizes.
7.⁠ ⁠*Evaluation*: Assess model accuracy using appropriate metrics.
8.⁠ ⁠*Output Saving*: Store model results for reporting and future use.

## Datasets
### 1. *Wildfire Dataset*
•⁠  ⁠*Size*: ~61 columns.
•⁠  ⁠*Attributes*: Fire event details, geospatial information, and associated environmental conditions.

### 2. *Weather Readings*
•⁠  ⁠*Entries*: Over 1 million.
•⁠  ⁠*Attributes*: Includes temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed.

### 3. *Weather Stations*
•⁠  ⁠*Metadata*: Contains station names, locations (latitude, longitude), and elevation.

## Key Libraries and Tools
•⁠  ⁠*Programming Language*: Python
•⁠  ⁠*Data Analysis*: Pandas, NumPy
•⁠  ⁠*Visualization*: Matplotlib, Seaborn
•⁠  ⁠*Machine Learning*: Scikit-learn
•⁠  ⁠*Notebook Environment*: Jupyter

## Results
•⁠  ⁠Initial model training results are saved for further analysis.
•⁠  ⁠Insights from feature importance and EDA provide a better understanding of key predictors.
